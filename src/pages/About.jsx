              I have over 4 cumulative years of experience with frontend
              development (the famous trio and more). I'm skilled in semantic
              HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript/jQuery and WordPress. I'm on a journey
              to master Javascript frameworks(React and Next). I'm amazing at
              organising my code, which, I believe, is a bonus. (

              Over the years of learning and always challenging myself I have
              developed skills to express my creative vision. My most valuable
              transferable skills are problem-solving and being exceptionally
              quick learner. Everybody says that you'd say, but I mean it.
