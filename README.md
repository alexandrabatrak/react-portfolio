_Lemme do it for you_ :brown_heart:

My latest porfolio built using React@latest.
Meant to be viewed in latest browser versions (best in webkit). Design inspired by my original WordPress portfolio. All style done purely in scss.

## Features

- [x] On-scroll animations
- [x] JSON format content delivered beautifully
- [x] Responsive (!)
- [x] Not boring at all loading screen
- [x] Slider for projects' screenshots

_P.S This is still work in progress (2 weeks was not enough)._
